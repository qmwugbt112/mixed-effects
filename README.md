mixed-effects
=============

Material for workshop on basic mixed effects models


In order to make use of these materials you will need to be running
R, ideally 3.x or later.  You will need internet access to install
libraries nlme and rrBLUP

First create your own personal dataset by running the R Scipt my_dataset.

Next run the analysis in mixed_effects

Finally lets do this for real with rrBLUP in the Script 'genomic estimation.R'

with a real SNP dataset HopperDat.csv
