mixed-effects
=============

Material for workshop on basic mixed effects models


In order to make use of these materials you will need to be running
R, ideally 3.x or later.  You will need internet access to install
libraries nlme, lattice and rrBLUP

First carry out the 'Analysis of Apple trees'.
The first step is to create your own unique dataset
(follow the instructions in the R script comments)

After completing that analysis, do it for real using the rrBLUP package
implemented in the 'genomic estimation' script. This uses a realistically
large grasshopper SNP dataset (actually a real dataset, HopperDat.csv).


The powerpoint slides for the course are also included
